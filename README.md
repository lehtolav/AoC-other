# AoC solutions from other years

These were just fired up without the "framework" to handle the AoC API as I was thinking it's not worth it.
I also stopped caring about the solving speed.
2022 has visualization stuff as I was thinking of getting to know some Haskell graphics/plotting library.
Only the first one has a visulization though, as it was not as interesting as I thought to make them.
